# Lambda Admin Module
A module for Lambda Players that allows Lambdas to become admins and enforce certain rules.

### Voice Types
This module adds two new Voice Types:
* adminscold  |  This Voice Type is used when a Admin scolds a offender
* sitrespond  |  This Voice Type is used when a offender responds to a Admin

### Text Types
This module adds two new Text Types:
* adminscold  |  This Text Type is used when a Admin scolds a offender
* sitrespond  |  This Text Type is used when a offender responds to a Admin

Literally the same thing.

You can add custom punishment lines as well via the text panel. All punish lines are labeled as punishreason
